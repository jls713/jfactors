These are the classical dwarfs and ultrafaints with J factors computed by Geringer-Sameth (2015).
Distances (in kpc) taken from McConnachie (2012) review.
Projected half-light radii (in pc) taken from McConnachie review. Errors "1" are upper error bars and "2" lower.
Line-of-sight velocity dispersions are in units km/s
All dark-matter annihilation and decay data taken from Geringer-Sameth. theta_max is the max angle integrated out to (in degrees). theta_half is the half-light radius angle for dm emission. All J are in units log10(GeV^2cm^-5).

The velocity dispersion for Segue II is the 95% upperbound from Kirby et al. (2013). The associated errors are reported as zero.

The data for RetII is taken from Bonnivard -- they do not report theta_half or dtheta_half so we set it as 0.5 deg.

Pisces II and Hydra II from Kirby (2015).

GrusI and Tucana II from Walker (2015)

Ellipticities from McConnachie (2012). DES dwarfs from Koposov (2015) (Horologium is upper bound, others have asymmetric errorbars), Pisces II from Belokurov (2014), Hydra II from Martin (2015)
Leo T: in de Jong (2008) the ellipticity is stated to be less than 0.1
